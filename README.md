This project serves a simple welcome page.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/` to see the welcome page. If this
   container exposes port 8080 to the Internet, others can reach it at the
   container's public URL.
